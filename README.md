# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application that demonstrates various sorting algorithms in real-time. This project helps learners and developers understand sorting concepts and algorithm behavior.

---

## Project Overview

The visualizer allows users to:

- Select from multiple sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- Watch the sorting process step by step with animated bars representing array elements.
- Adjust the size of the array and the speed of visualization.
- Learn algorithm efficiency in a visual and intuitive way.

Tech Stack:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Tools: Git for version control
- Optional: Can be extended with React for modular component-based design
